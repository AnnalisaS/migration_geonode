Recommended Minimum System Requirements
=======================================

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server, the following are the *bare minimum* system requirements:

* 6GB of RAM, including swap space.
* 2.2GHz processor. (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)
* 1 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware recommended.
